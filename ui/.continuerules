Whenever you write React code, make sure to:
• Use TypeScript.
• Use .tsx files.
• Use functional components by define export default function instead of class components.
• Use hooks for state management.
• Define interfaces for component props.
• Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
• Use ShadCN components.
• Modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces.
• Provide only code and explanations—do not include installation instructions.
